And yet, you forgot it. The only way to never forget anything is using a *mind extension*. This is any tool which you use to hold **everything** that you must keep in mind. From pen & paper to [Workflowy][4], here are the key points to succesfully managing it.

### The case for using a mind extension
You simply can't trust your brain with everything. That's OK, you don't have ADHD. We simply [deal with a lot of information][1], and have [always done so][2].

Trying to remember everything is not only frustrating: it is a sure way to missing opportunities and generally *wasting time*.

But buying into a tool is not enough. Using it correctly is key, and these are the tips that help me do so everyday.


#### Note down absolutely everything
Never wonder if you should write something down. Simply do. Taking the burden off of your brain is the first step to organization.

#### Stop meta-time-wasting
Meta-time-wasting is wasting time hunting the golden productivity tool which will solve all your problems. Unfortunately, there is *no such thing*. Use whichever tool is the simplest and offers lowest friction. The important thing is to...

#### Have discipline
No matter how many incredible tools or gadgets you use, none of them is going to actually make you write things down. You must discipline yourself to update your extended mind whenever a new task arises (or gets completed). This will take time: don't get disappointed in yourself for not having a flawless score the first few weeks.

#### Check your mind extension regularly
There's is no use in having an extra memory if you are not aware of it. During the day, check to see if there's anything more you could do right now. Also, many tools have reminders of all sorts to help you remember at the right time.

#### Plan for the next day or next week
At the end of each day, or week, set your goals for the next period. Assess if your planning for the past period was accurate and decide which tasks you'll be able to accomplish next.

#### Big projects: divide and conquer
Monumental tasks are too intimidating. Instead, [follow the goal creep][3] and divide it in smaller, manageable chunks, each with a visible deadline.
