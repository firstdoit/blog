        <section class="content"><p>This saturday, I’ve been to the <a href="http://www.riojs.org/">Rio.JS</a> conference, a Rio de Janeiro-based Javascript developer event. I would like to congratulate the organizers for the effort, as I am sure that pulling such an event is no easy feat, and the formation of a local community is a noble intent.</p>
<p>One of the presenters, <a href="http://hugolnx.com/">Hugo Roque</a> asked for feedback on his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hugolnx/apresentacao-17070731">lecture</a>. Here, I’ll try and offer some opinions on his proposed solutions which I hope will be helpful.</p>
<span class="more"></span>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-suspect-your-public-knows-the-basics-of-your-subject-be-quick-presenting-it.">If you suspect your public knows the basics of your subject, be quick presenting it.</h3>
<p>At a javascript developer conference, I feel there is no need to explain the uses or benefits of AJAX. This technology is sufficiently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)#History">old and commonplace</a> that the time would be better used with more advanced discussion.</p>
<h3 id="save-a-reference-to-your-jqxhr-object">Save a reference to your jqXHR object</h3>
<p>One of the common pitfalls of asynchronous communication is the lack of user feedback, <em>e.g.</em>, no <em>loading</em> hint is shown after a user presses a button that needs communication and/or processing. To avoid making multiple requests as a result of the user clicking the button multiple times, the presenter recommends the following:</p>
<pre><code>$(&quot;a&quot;).one(&quot;click&quot;, function (event) { 
    $.get(&quot;http://site.com&quot;, function (html) {
        //do something
    });
    event.preventDefault();
});</code></pre>
<p>According to the jQuery documentation, with the <code>one</code> method,</p>
<pre><code>&quot;the handler is unbound after its first invocation.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This isn’t very useful if your button is ever going to be clicked again. A nicer way to achieve the same effect is by saving a reference to the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR</a> object which is returned by any ajax call, and reacting to it’s existence:</p>
<pre><code>var myRequestToken = undefined;
$(&#39;#my-button&#39;).click(function (e) {
    if (myRequestToken) {
        // There is a request going on - ignore this click.
        return false;
    }
    // Save a reference to the jqXHR. It is also a promise! (more on that soon)
    myRequestToken = $.get(&#39;/promises/are/awesome/&#39;);

    // After the request is done and returns the data successfuly, run this function.
    myRequestToken.done(function (data) { 
        // Do something
    });

    // The request is complete - either with success or failure. 
    // Anyway, clean the reference and enable a new click.        
    myRequestToken.always(function (data) {
        myRequestToken = undefined;
    });    
});</code></pre>
<p>In this fashion, we have enabled the button to be clicked again after any communication is done. This, however, doesn’t solve the UX problem. Which leads us to…</p>
<h3 id="be-economic-with-your-dom-manipulation">Be economic with your DOM manipulation</h3>
<p>Adding and removing DOM is one of the most common use cases for Javascript, and is also one of the nastiest. Manipulating the DOM in a imperative fashion is a fast-track to pain. This is why the community is currently drowning on a multitude of <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/">MVC frameworks</a>, <a href="http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/">templating engines</a> and whatnot.</p>
<p>One of the classic misuses of jQuery is adding an arbitrary <code>img</code> tag after an event:</p>
<pre><code>$(&quot;a&quot;).one(&quot;click&quot;, function (event) {
    var img = $(&quot;&lt;img src=&#39;images/loading.gif&#39;&gt;&quot;);
    img.appendTo(document.body);
    $.get(&quot;http://site.com&quot;, function () {
        // faz alguma coisa
        img.remove();
    });
});</code></pre>
<p>This has the added disadvantage of starting to load the image only after the node is appended. That means a user on a slow connection will continue to receive no feedback on your ajax button, because the loading image will not appear until it itself is loaded.</p>
<p>The solution can be, in fact, much simpler:</p>
<pre><code>// CSS
.hide { display: none; }
.active { display: block; }

// In the DOM
&lt;img src=&quot;images/loading.gif&quot; id=&quot;my-button-spinner&quot; class=&quot;hide&quot;/&gt;

// Activate loading
$(&#39;#my-button-spinner&#39;).addClass(&#39;active&#39;);

// Hide loading
$(&#39;#my-button-spinner&#39;).removeClass(&#39;active&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>This is, of course, considering you are not using one of the template or MVC frameworks which will present their own solutions.</p>
<h3 id="use-promises-not-callbacks.">Use Promises, not callbacks.</h3>
<p>One of the “recent” advancements in the Javascript is the growing usage of the <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/01/29/whats-so-great-about-javascript-promises/">Promises</a> pattern. There is a plethora of tutorials and implementations to be found by Googling, and I suggest you get up to speed if you haven’t so far.</p>
<p>Promises can be found in lots of places - including jQuery. In fact, the <code>jqXHR</code> implements a Promise interface. This enables us to do some interesting things with it:</p>
<pre><code>var firstAsyncCall = $.get(&#39;/some/info/1&#39;);
var secondAsyncCall = $.get(&#39;/some/info/2&#39;);
// Only act when both calls are completed successfully!
$.when(firstAsyncCall, secondAsyncCall).done(function(result1, result2){
    // Act on both results.
});</code></pre>
<p>This is but a simple example of what you can accomplish with promises. So, stop using <code>success</code> and <code>error</code> callbacks and get to know the <code>done</code>, <code>fail</code> and <code>always</code> family of methods in the jqXHR.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Delivering a presentation is a hard task for most, and I thank Hugo for his effort. I hope he is not offended by this post and I’m looking forward for his next talk.</p>
